# Self evaluation

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
  * I feel about 75% confident with Arrays so far.  The most challenging part for me right now is getting the proper lingo down.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
  * I understand that Boolean is a data type using true/false but I would like to see it used in a real coding application and how it works. It took me a while to figure out that I had to declare elements as true/false; then create one variable with the elements listed within it.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
  * What are the most common/used methods that entry level coders should familiarize themselves with?
